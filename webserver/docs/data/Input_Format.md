# Guide to prepare the uploaded files for scSVAS online applications


## Run scSVAS offline scripts for CNV related applications

First, run `scSVAS.py` to get the

##### `cnv.csv` <required>

`cnv.csv` stores the copy number profiles of cells, with cell as row and bin region as column. The first column should be the cell IDs, and the first row should be bin region, e.g. `chr1:1-512000`. User can directly use the `cnv.csv` file generated by SCYN. Please note that the column bin regions are recommended to be equal size for best heatmap visualization effect.

##### `meta.csv` [optional]

`meta.csv` stores the meta information of cells, with cell as row, and meta information as column. User can directly use the `meta.csv` file generated by SCYN, or manually one. The following are examples of meta fields:

 + `c_gini`: stores the gini coeficient of each cell.
 + `c_ploidy`: stores the mean ploidy of each cell, it is calculated from `prefix_cnv.csv` (not the one SCOPE provide).

After running `scSVAS.py`, user can get `prefix_meta_scvar.csv` with additional meta fields:

Prefix `c` here denotes numeric continuous value. The absence of prefix `c` denotes category meta information like 'group' or 'cluster'. Prefix `e` refers to embedding and dimension reduction. User can manually add extra cell meta information like 'cell_type' and 'group' for downstream analysis:

 + `cell_type`: predefined cell types.
 + `group`: predefined cell groups.
